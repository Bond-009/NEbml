### What is this repository for? ###

NEbml provides facility to read/write EBML binary format. The idea of EBML is similar to XML, as it is:

 * made of tagged records
 * stores both atomic and compaund objects

Unlike XML the EBML is very efficient in space and performance terms.

### How do I get set up? ###

* use nuget `Install-Package NEbml`
* Binaries are build for .NET 3.5 but there're no difficulties adapting the code to .NET 2.0
* Use Nunit to run the unit tests. Unit tests are compiled only for DEBUG configuration.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines
